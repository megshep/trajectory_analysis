%set working directory for where my normalised and smoothed scans are
cd /scratch/j90161ms/rc1_clean

%find all normalised scans| excluding any with 'avg' in their names (previous analysis produced these, they're not needed)| keep everything ordered
ls smwrc*.nii 2>/dev/null | grep -vi avg | sort > all_smwrc_files.txt

%tell me how many scans made it into the txt file (sanity check that all are included in the .txt doc)
wc -l all_smwrc_files.txt
